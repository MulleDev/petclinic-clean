## Railway Deployment Setup

This application is deployed on Railway, providing fast and reliable cloud hosting.

### Initial Setup:
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to existing project (if already deployed)
railway link

# Or create new project
railway login
railway init
```

### Deployment Process:
```bash
# Deploy current branch
railway up

# Or simply push to main branch for automatic deployment
git push origin main
```

### Railway Features:
- **Automatic Builds**: Detects Maven/Java projects automatically
- **Environment Variables**: Managed through Railway dashboard
- **Custom Domains**: HTTPS enabled by default
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and logging
- **Zero Downtime**: Rolling deployments

### Environment Configuration:
Railway automatically detects the Maven project and uses:
- Java 17+ runtime
- Maven build process
- Port binding from `$PORT` environment variable
- Health checks via Spring Boot Actuator

## Building a Container

The application can be containerized using Spring Boot's built-in support:

```bash
# Build container image with Maven
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image

# Or create custom Dockerfile if needed
docker build -t petclinic .
docker run -p 8080:8080 petclinic
```

Railway supports both buildpack and Docker deployments automatically.

## Database Configuration

The application supports multiple database configurations through Spring profiles:

### Default Configuration (H2):
- **In-Memory Database**: H2 database populated at startup
- **H2 Console**: Available at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
- **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:<uuid>` (UUID printed at startup)
- **Profile**: Default (no profile needed)

### Production Databases:
```bash
# MySQL Profile
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql

# PostgreSQL Profile  
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=postgres
```

### Database Setup with Docker:
```bash
# MySQL
docker run -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.0

# PostgreSQL
docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=petclinic -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=petclinic -e POSTGRES_DB=petclinic -p 5432:5432 postgres:15-alpine
```

### Railway Database:
For production deployment on Railway, you can easily add:
- **PostgreSQL**: Railway Postgres plugin
- **MySQL**: Railway MySQL plugin
- **Environment Variables**: Automatically configured by Railway

The application automatically detects and uses Railway's database environment variables when deployed.

### Docker Compose Support:
The project includes `docker-compose.yml` for easy database setup:
```bash
# Start MySQL
docker compose up mysql

# Start PostgreSQL
docker compose up postgres
```

## Development and Testing
